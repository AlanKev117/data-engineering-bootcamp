# Wizeline Data Engineering Bootcamp Challenge
---
> Welcome to my solution to the challenge. I am excited for you to see my approach.

### Just before you begin to explore...

There a re a few points to take into consideration:

* My approach was developed and run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13YLbhAuGwUTEnb_8CN4oHftQ_0PvX96r?usp=sharing) because of the dedicated environment for Python notebooks. This let me access to the 20GB file (1.5GB compressed) more comfortably since Drive accounts are easily linkable to Colab. Thus, make sure to have access to a Drive account that has the large file within (further instructions are included in the [notebook](https://github.com/AlanKev117/data-engineering-bootcamp/blob/main/project.ipynb)).
* If you dont have access to such account, you can add a reference to your Drive unit [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1crFR4yrS_6DV3_Fh-HrhANJg1-qlyE-O/view) y clicking the Drive icon with the plus sign.
* I did not include the report in the repository, since it is better hosted in [Notion](https://acidic-burrito-223.notion.site/Wizeline-s-Data-Engineering-Bootcamp-Project-45cc1811fc4a49669ed4ca343d492120).

Go ahead and have as much fun as I did.
